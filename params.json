Hopefully, it will look better in the future.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nClone and run `cargo run` in the project's directory. The UI is pretty\r\nself-explanatory. Use `Escape` to exit.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nRequires Rust, Cargo and ALSA to compile.\r\n\r\n## Quirks\r\n\r\nThe Microbrute has to be connected BEFORE running Microbrust. No\r\nauto- or re-connecting right now. Microbrust will fail if you disconnect\r\nMicrobrute in the meantime. Sorry... but there is a chance I will fix this\r\nin the future.\r\n\r\n## Questions and issues\r\n\r\nUse Github's issue tracker for bug or feature requests. [Drop me\r\na line](mailto:jakub.matraszek@gmail.com) if you want to ask about\r\nanything that is not a bug/feature request.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nYou can check out the full license [here](https://github.com/jmatraszek/microbrust/blob/master/LICENSE)\r\nThis project is licensed under the terms of the **GNU GPLv3.0** license.\r\n",
